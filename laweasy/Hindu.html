                <h2>Conditions for a valid marriage under Hindu Marriage Act.</h2>
                    <p>No party should be already married, i.e. neither party should have a spouse living at the time of marriage. Thus, this Act prohibits polygamy.</br>
At the time of marriage, neither party should be incapable of giving valid consent due to unsoundness of mind. Even if he/she is capable of giving valid consent, should not be suffering from a mental disorder to an extent which makes him/her unfit for marriage and procreation of children. He/she should not be subject to recurring attacks of insanity either.</br>
The parties should not be underage. The bridegroom should be a minimum of 21 years of age, and the bride should be at least 18 years old.</br>
The parties should not be sapindas or within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless any custom governing them allows marriage between such relations.</br>
</p>
                <h2>Void marriage under HMA</h2>
                     <p>Either of the parties is already married and has a spouse living at the time of marriage.</br>
Either party is underage, i.e. groom below 21 years of age and bride below 18 years.</br>
The parties are sapindas or within the degrees of prohibited relationship.</p>
				<h2>Voidable marriage under HMA</h2>
                    <p>If either party is impotent and therefore unable to consummate the marriage.</br>
When at the time of marriage, either party is not capable of giving valid consent due to unsoundness of mind. Even if he/she is capable of giving valid consent, has been suffering from mental disorder to an extent which makes him/her unfit for marriage and procreation of children, or is subject to recurring attacks of insanity.</br>
If the consent was obtained forcefully, or fraudulently.
If the bride was pregnant by another man other than the groom at the time of marriage.</p>
                <h2>Ceremonies to be performed for a marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act:</h2>
                    <p> Section 7 of the Act states that a Hindu marriage can be duly performed in accordance with ceremonies and customs of either the bride or the groom. These ceremonies also include the Saptapadi i.e. taking of seven steps jointly before the sacred fire.</br>

It has been stated that if Saptapadi is included in the rites and ceremonies, then the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken.</p>
