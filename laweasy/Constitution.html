                <h2>What is a Constitution?</h2>
                    <p>A constitution is a written document that contains a set of rules for a government. It defines the fundamental political principles establishing the structure, procedures, powers, and duties of a government. It limits the power of the government to prevent exploitation and guarantees certain rights to the people. The term constitution can be applied to any overall law that defines the functioning of a government.</p>
                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                     <p>A Drafting Committee was set up by the Constituent Assembly on 29th August 1947 to frame the Indian Constitution under the chairmanship of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. It took almost three years to draft the Constitution holding eleven sessions over a 165 day period. The Constitution of India draws extensively from Western legal traditions in its outline of the principles of liberal democracy. It follows a British parliamentary pattern with a lower and upper house. It embodies some Fundamental Rights which are similar to the Bill of Rights declared by the United States Constitution. It also borrows the concept of a Supreme Court from the United States.
</br>
The Indian Constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and was made effective on 26 January 1950 which is celebrated as the Republic Day. The Constitution replaced the Government of India Act, 1935 as the country's fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To ensure constitutional autochthony (the process of asserting constitutional nationalism from an external legal or political power), its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament by enacting Article 395 of the Indian Constitution.</p>
				<h2>Preamble to the Constitution of India</h2>
                    <p>References from The Preamble highlights few fundamental values and guiding principles on which the Constitution of India is based. It serves as the guiding light for both, the Constitution as well as the judges who interpret the Constitution in its light. The opening few words of the Preamble – “We, the people" – signifies that the power is vested in the hands of the people of India. The Preamble is as follows:
</br>
"WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:
JUSTICE, social, economic and political;</br>
LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;</br>
EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;
</br>IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION."

</br>Initially, the preamble was not the part of the Constitution of India but the Supreme Court, in the case of ‘Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala’ found it to be a part of the Constitution which is essential to interpret ambiguous areas of the Constitution.</p>
                <h2>Terms of the preamble explained</h2>
                    <p>Sovereign – It means supreme or independent. The preamble declares the Republic of India as both, internally as well as externally sovereign. Externally it is free from any foreign power and internally it exercises a free government directly elected by the people and makes laws that govern the people.
</br>
Socialist – The word was added by the 42nd amendment act of 1976. It implies social and economic equality. Social equality means there is no discrimination on the grounds of caste, color, creed, sex, religion, language, etc. Each one enjoys equal status and opportunities. By economic equality it means that the government will endeavor for equal distribution of wealth and to provide a decent standard of living for all, hence a commitment in forming a welfare state. Abolition of Untouchability and Zamindari, the Equal Wages Act and the Child Labour Prohibition Act were few steps taken by the government in this context.
</br>
Secular – The word was inserted by the 42nd amendment act of 1976. Secular implies equality of all religions and religious tolerance. No state in India has an official state religion. Anybody can preach, practice and propagate any religion of his or her choice. In the eyes of law, all citizens are equal irrespective of their religious beliefs. No religious instruction is imparted in government schools or government-aided schools.
</br>
Democratic – This means that the government of all levels is elected by the people through a system of universal adult franchise. Every citizen irrespective of caste, creed, color, sex, religion or education who is 18 years of age and above is entitled to vote, if not debarred by law.
</br>
Republic – The term means that the head of the state is elected, directly or indirectly, for a fixed tenure. The President of India is elected by the Electoral College for a fixed period of five years.</p>
