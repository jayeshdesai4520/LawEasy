                <h2>What is Income Tax?</h2>
                    <p>Income tax is a tax levied on the income of an individual or an entity. It is one of the primary source of revenue of the government of India. The government undertakes various functions including welfare and development activities related to health, education and rural development etc. for which it requires public finance. Taxes are one of the major source through which the government raises revenue for public spending and it has been broadly categorized into the following two sections:

</br>Direct taxes- These include taxes which are paid by the person on whom these are levied like income tax, corporation tax, etc.

</br>Indirect taxes- These include taxes levied on goods and services rather than on income or profits like Goods and Services Tax.</p>
                <h2>Law Governing Income Tax in India</h2>
                     <p>Income Tax is usually the most visible and discussed component of the Indian tax system. It is generally believed that taxes on income are phenomena of modern days. However, there is enough evidence to show that taxes on income were levied in ancient days in India as well. In this regard, references can be made to the ancient scriptures like Manusmriti and Kautiliyan Arthashastra.  </br>

In the modern India, the law related to income tax was introduced for the first time in 1860 to overcome the financial crisis of 1857. Thereafter, the Income Tax (IT) Act of 1886, IT Act of 1918 and IT Act of 1922 were introduced, however, these acts were repealed later due to their inconsistency with the changing requirements of the Indian society. Later, with the consultation of the Ministry of Law the Income Tax Act 1961 was brought into effect which is currently operative in India.</p>
				<h2>Provisions under the Income Tax Act</h2>
                    <p>The Income Tax Act, 1961 is the Indian statute that provides for levy, administration, collection and recovery of income tax in India. It contains 23 chapters, 298 sections and 14 schedules in total. Under the Income Tax Act, every person, who is an assessee and whose income exceeds the maximum exemption limit, shall be chargeable to the income tax at the rate or rates prescribed in the Finance Act, such income tax will be paid on the total income of the previous year in the relevant assessment year. Assessment year is a period of 12 months starting from 1st day of April every year and ending on 31st day of March of the next year and previous year/financial year is the 12 months period before the assessment year. </br>

Though there is no specific definition of the term, income as per section 2(24) of the Act means and includes salary, income from house property, profits and gains of business and profession, capital gains and income from other sources. Income tax returns has to be filed compulsorily by every tax payer such as individual, Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), firms, companies etc. whose income exceeds the exemption limit. Income Tax Act, provides penalty for non-filing of income tax returns. The last date of filing income tax return is July 31 in case of individuals but in case of business or professional, the last date for filing the return is 31st October and the penalty for non-filing of income tax returns is Rs. 5,000. </p>
                <h2>What are the categories under which income tax is calculated?</h2>
                    <p>INCOME FROM HOUSE PROPERTY </br>
SECTION 22 of the Act provides as follows:</br>
“The annual value of property consisting of any buildings or lands appurtenant thereto of which the assessee is the owner other than such portions of such property as he may occupy for the purposes of any business or Profession carried on by him, the profits of which are chargeable to income tax, shall be chargeable to income tax under the head from House Property.”
</br>
Tax is charged on income from the buildings or lands appurtenant thereto: the buildings include residential buildings, buildings let out for business or profession or auditoriums for entertainment purposes. Tax is charged on income from lands appurtenant to buildings: the lands appurtenant to buildings include approach roads to and from public streets, courtyards, compound, playground, motor garage. In case of non-residential buildings, car parking spaces, drying grounds shall be the lands appurtenant to buildings.
</br>
Tax is charged from the owner of the buildings and lands appurtenant thereto: where the recipient of the Income from House Property is not the owner of the building, the income is not chargeable under this head but under the head ‘Income from Business or Other Sources.’
</br>
INCOME FROM BUSINESS OR PROFESSION</br>
The provisions of Sections 28 to 44D deal with the method of computing income under head “ Profits and Gains of Business or Profession.”
</br>
The meaning of the expression ‘Business’ has been defined in Section 2(13) of the Income Tax Act. According to this definition, business includes any trade, commerce or manufacture or any adventure or concern in the nature of trade commerce or manufacture.
</br>
The concept of business presupposes the carrying on of any activity for profit, the definition of business given in the Act does not make it essential for any taxpayer to carry on his activities constituting business for a considerable length of time.
</br>
The expression ‘profession’ has been defined in Section 2 (36) of the Act to include any vocation. The term profession includes the concept of an occupation requiring either intellectual skill or manual skill controlled and directed by the intellectual skill of the creator. For instance an auditor, a lawyer or a doctor carrying on their profession and not business.
</br>
The common feature in the case of both profession as well as business is that the object of carrying them out is to derive income or to make profit.</p>
