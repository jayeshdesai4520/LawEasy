                <h2>Brief History of IPC</h2>
                    <p>The IPC came into existence in 1860 on recommendations of the first law commission of India established in 1834 under the Charter Act of 1833. The Code was made effective during the British rule in January 1, 1862 and was applicable to the whole of the then British India except the princely states as they had their own courts and legal systems till 1940s. 
The Code was later adopted by the Independent India and Pakistan after partition. The Ranbir Penal Code applicable in Jammu and Kashmir is also based on this Code. It is applicable to all the citizens of India. The IPC has been amended numerous times since then and is now supplemented by various other criminal provisions. At present, the IPC is divided into 23 chapters and contains 511 sections in total.</p>
					
                <h2>Provisions under the Indian Penal Code</h2>
                     <p>Indian Penal Code has laid down as to what is a wrong and what is the punishment for committing such wrong. This Code consolidates the whole of the law on the subject and is exhaustive on the matters in respect of which it declares the law. A chapter-wise summary of the important provisions of the Code has been laid down as follows: 

</br> 1.	Chapter IV- General Exceptions
IPC recognizes defenses in chapter four under the heading ‘General Exceptions.’ Sections 76 to 106 of the IPC cover these defenses. The law offers certain defenses that protects a person from criminal liability. These defenses are based on the premise that though the person committed the offense, he cannot be held liable. This is because, at the time of the commission of the offense, either the prevailing circumstances were such that the act of the person was justified or his condition was such that he could not form the requisite mens rea (guilty intention) for the crime. The defenses are generally classified under two heads- justifiable and excusable. Thus, for committing a wrong, a person must be responsible for doing a wrongful act without having any justification or excuse for it. 

</br> 2.	Chapter V- Abetment
A crime may be committed by one or more persons involved in crime then their liability depends upon the extent of their participation. Thus this rule of joint liability comes into existence. But there is an important fact which is that the law has a knowledge about the abettor, who has given help to another in crime. This rule is very ancient and was applied in Hindu Law also. In English Law, criminals are divided in four categories, but in India there is only one distinction between the doer and his helper who is known as abettor. The crime of abetment come under section 107 to 120 of the IPC. Section 107 defines ‘abetment of a things’ and section l08 defines the abettor. 

</br> 3.	Chapter VI- Offences against the State
Chapter VI, Section 121 to Section 130 of the Indian Penal Code deals with offences against State. The Indian Penal Code 1860 has made provisions to safeguard and preserve State's existence and has provided the most severe punishment of the death sentence or life imprisonment and fine in case of offence against the state. This chapter includes offences like waging war, collecting arms to wage war, sedition, etc.

Chapter XVI (Sections 299 to 311) of the Penal Code criminalizes acts affecting the human body i.e. those that cause death and physical harm, including grievous harm, assault, sexual offences and wrongful confinement.
